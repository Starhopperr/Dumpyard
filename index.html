        <p>
            There are many types of monsters in this world, monsters who will not show themselves and who cause trouble.<br>
            Monsters who abduct children, monsters who devour dreams, monsters who suck blood, and monsters who always tell lies.<br>
            <br>
            Lying monsters are a real nuisance.<br>
            They are much more cunning than other monsters.<br>
            They pose as humans, even though they have no understanding of the human heart.<br>
            They eat, even though they've never experienced hunger.<br>
            They study even though the have no interest in academics.<br>
            They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love.<br>
            If I were to encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten by it because, in truth, I am that monster
